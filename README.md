### What works?

### Not Tested or Not working
- Ethernet Port - I always use wifi (Maybe it works)
- HMDI - not needed for me (Probably works)
- Audio Jack - Not required (You can find drivers if you need it)
Other things which i donâ€™t need however you can find drivers for anything you need, just test them one by one






### CFG Lock and others These vars are from [Bios v1.12.1](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-uk/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=h08hj&oscode=wt64a&productcode=inspiron-15-7567-laptop)
You can use them if your bios is updated and you have the same laptop! Or you will need to find yours.
You must enter these in modGRUBShell.efi which is included in the tools folder already.
You can check if the var is already set using setup_var 0x4de (this checks for CFG Lock)
- 0x01 = enabled
- 0x00 = disabled
```
disable cfg lock
setup_var 0x4DE 0x00 

enable above 4GB MMIO BIOS assignment
setup_var 0x78A 0x01

disable CSM Support
setup_var 0xF84 0x00
```

You must follow this [OpenCore guide to get these Fixing CFG Lock | OpenCore Post-Install (dortania.github.io)](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/msr-lock.html#what-is-cfg-lock) , there is a Dell link you can use to extract bios and the file and everything will be in the file you converted to text.

Use VerifyMsrE2 (Already in tools folder)
 To check CFG Lock , if you get 
`This firmware has UNLOCKED MSR 0xE2 register!`
 That means you have working CFG Lock!
